## Project Summary
*Projects and Exercises Inspired by Key Python Textbooks*  

Based on topics explored in my Python reference tomes,
a variety of follow alongs and related topics are explored.

Primary reference documents in my library include:
* [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280)

Topics include:
* Kitchen sinks
* Most everything else :)

Note that projects associated with specific topics are located in
their related repositories.  For instance, code/projects 
associated with the book _Pandas for Everyone_ 
are in the  [Scipy](https://github.com/TonySelfStudy/scipy) repository.
